# Indian Sign Language

Indian Sign Language is a translation system designed to bridge communication gaps by converting Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures into text and speech in real-time. This project leverages computer vision and machine learning models to recognize ISL gestures and translate them into natural language text, making communication more accessible for the hearing and speech-impaired community.

## Features

- **Real-time Gesture Recognition**: Uses computer vision to capture and interpret ISL gestures.
- **Text and Speech Output**: Translates recognized gestures into text and synthesizes them into speech.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Offers translation into multiple languages, enhancing accessibility.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be intuitive and accessible.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/grimreapermanasvi/Indian_Sign_Language.git
   cd Indian_Sign_Language
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure that your environment supports necessary libraries for computer vision and NLP.

## Usage

Run the application with:
```bash
python app.py
```

Place your hand in the frame, and the system will capture and interpret the ISL gestures, displaying the translated text and generating corresponding speech output.
